Enable users to delete individual products from their shopping cart Description:
As a customer, I want to delete unwanted products from my shopping cart so that I can remove items I no longer wish to purchase.
This functionality should be accessible on the cart page, with a clear delete or remove icon/button for each product line item. Once deleted, the product should be immediately removed from the cart view, and the total amount should be updated accordingly. This feature should be supported for both logged-in users and guest users (with session-based carts). Acceptance Criteria: Each item on the cart page must show a visible delete option. When an item is deleted, it should be removed from the cart, and the totals must update accordingly. If all items are deleted, the cart should display an “empty cart” message with a link to continue shopping.
