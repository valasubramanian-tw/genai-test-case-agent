You are a member of a QA team responsible for testing an application. Using the JIRA story information provided, generate comprehensive test scenarios that combine exploratory testing with story-driven approaches.

## CONTEXT DESCRIPTION:
~JIRA Story Summary:~

Shopping Cart - Allow customers to delete Cart Products

~JIRA Story Description:~

Summary:
Enable users to delete individual products from their shopping cart

Description:
As a customer, I want to delete unwanted products from my shopping cart so that I can remove items I no longer wish to purchase.
This functionality should be accessible on the cart page, with a clear delete or remove icon/button for each product line item. Once deleted, the product should be immediately removed from the cart view, and the total amount should be updated accordingly. This feature should be supported for both logged-in users and guest users (with session-based carts).

Acceptance Criteria:

Each item on the cart page must show a visible delete option. When an item is deleted, it should be removed from the cart, and the totals must update accordingly. If all items are deleted, the cart should display an “empty cart” message with a link to continue shopping.

## OBJECTIVE
Based on the context provided, please generate in-depth, specific exploratory test scenarios that target critical functionalities, unexpected behaviors, and key edge cases.

You analysis and identify various scenarios including happy paths, sad paths, exceptional edge case scenarios, and associate each scenario with a priority level for implementation.

Choose priorities of high, medium or low to determine the order in which scenario should be implemented, and list those with high priority first.

## Instructions
You will create at least one scenario for each path.
You will respond with a specific format: Markdown or Table or JSON format.
You will check if I have provided any specific format for you to respond, otherwise you will use Markdown format.
Markdown format with brief description, given/when/then sentence, priority, putting each part of the scenario in a new line.
Table format with the columns: Number, brief description, GIVEN-WHEN-THEN-scenario sentence, suggestion of a priority level
JSON format with properties title, test case, priority.
{user_instructions}


{example_format}
Use the following format:

## Happy paths
**GIVEN** <preparation step to set up the test> 
**WHEN** <action taken by a user, or some other event occurring>
**THEN** <expected result>

## Sad paths
... (repeat the above format for each sad path)

## Exceptional paths
... (repeat the above format for each exceptional path)

An example from a different domain:
## Happy paths
**GIVEN** a user is logged in
**AND** they are on the Hotel search page
**WHEN** they search for Hotels in a specific location and at a specific time
**THEN** a list of all available Hotels associated with that location is displayed based on their price in ascending order





You will respond with only a valid JSON array of scenario objects. Each scenario object will have the following schema:
    
    - "title": <string>,
    - "category": <string>,
    - "summary": <string>,
    - "probability": <string>, (including reasons)
    - "likelihood": <string>, (including reasons)
    - "impact": <string>, (including reasons)

Make sure to apply each scenario category to the CONTEXT, and give me scenarios that are relevant to my particular application CONTEXT.

Pretend like I don't know about my own instructions and explain everything in detail to me, as I want to send your input to the rest of my team who don't know about STRIDE.
